## The following case study was completed as a capstone project for the Google Data Analytics certificate course.

### Cyclistic:

Cyclistic is a fictional bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations.

The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

But first, Cyclistic executives must approve our recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

I will use Cyclistic’s historical trip data to analyze and identify trends.
